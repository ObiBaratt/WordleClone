## About

When I was visiting my mom this summer I noticed her and her friends were _obsessed_ with this game.
Not only would they make time to play it every morning, but would also religiously play a host of other similar games.

## The issue?
The official [Worlde](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) game only has one play per day.

## My solution:
Use web scraping to get their word list, and make a clone of the game with unlimited replay.

## Why this project?
Before this I had been mainly working with Flask learning about the backend using Jinja HTML templating as my frontend:
<br/>
For example: my [Workout Web app](https://workout-web.herokuapp.com/)
(also hosted on Heroku) [and it's repo](https://github.com/ObiBaratt/Workout-Web).

<br/>

This was my first JavaScript project, I based it off of a few different tutorials, my HTML/CSS knowledge, and dug into the MDN docs to figure out all the things I didn't know!
